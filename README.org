#+title: Readme

This is a very simple POC for using Go + Templ and instead of using markdown like in the example here https://templ.guide/static-rendering/blog-example I'm using org files similar to how hugo would using the go-org parser https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org

** Using the program
Add Org posts to ~/posts~ and then run ~go run . serve~ to generate the site and serve with a very simple server at ~localhost:8080~.

There would be much more to add for this to be useable, things like:
- [ ] Live Reloading
- [ ] Better Filename handling
  Personally, I wonder if we could get the date from a ~#+Date:~ in the org header content.

That being said, luckily we should be able to add components, html, etc. easily, though we'd need a good way to do so in the middle of blog posts if we wanted that functionality.
